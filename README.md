# AMS
Absence Management System

OVERVIEW
To allow planned absences to be managed better a user friendly interface allowing team members to enter
their planned absence is required. The interface should allow users to view other team memberâ€™s planned
absence and highlight to them any clashes with other team members of any absence they enter. The
entered absence, once confirmed by the team member should then be passed to the server to be logged in
the console.
